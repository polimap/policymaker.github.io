<h2><a id="faq"></a>Important Notes about PolicyMaker 5</h2>

<h3>About Saving Data</h3>
<p>
PolicyMaker 5 uses the HTML 5 feature known as <i>local storage</i> to save your work as you enter data.
We strongly recommend that you frequently use the <i>Export</i> feature to save your work as a file locally
on your computer's hard disk.  The Export button is located on the Welcome or Select Project page.
Please try exporting your project before you have entered much data.  You can then practice reloading your project using the 
<i>Import</i> button.
</p>

<p>To export your project, click on the <i>Export</i> button.  Then, click on the link in the dialog box. 
The file (with a ".json" extension) can then be named and saved appropriately.</p>

<p>While local storage is useful, it can be erased when you empty your browser's cache or do other operations on your computer.  
It is also associated with the server from which you opened PolicyMaker.  If you use a different server,
you will no longer see your projects.
Note that it has a limit of approximately 2.5m characters.  The <i>Projects</i> button on the Welcome screen
can be clicked to view a dialog box listing your current Local Storage projects and an estimate of how
much local storage has been used.</p>

<p>PolicyMaker has been tested using Chrome on Macs and PCs. While it may be possible to use PolicyMaker in a 
limited fashion on a mobile device, we recommend that you practice exporting and importing data.  Some mobile 
operating systems may not allow you to save or easily access downloaded content. In other words, <strong><i>you may not 
be able to export, import, or share your projects</i></strong>. There may be other problems as well.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Note</i>: PolicyMaker includes an example PolicyMaker project, Clinton's Health
Care Reform, to illustrate procedures described in this help page.
This sample is not based on a definitive study, but is included as a common
reference point for the help page and for users, as an illustrative example of
how to apply PolicyMaker. We apologize for any inaccuracies, if any, it may
contain. It should be regarded as a work of fiction, not fact.</p>
<p>The example project can be edited in the browser, but your changes are not saved to local storage, 
nor can it be exported.</p>

</div>

<p>Policymaking is a profoundly political process. Politics affects all
aspects of policymaking--what gets on the agenda, who supports an issue, who
opposes an issue, how advice is provided and how advice is received, whether
an issue receives official approval, and whether the official policy is
implemented. In short, policymakers are inevitably involved with politics.</p>

<p>Yet many policymakers do not use a formal method of political analysis.
Politicians tend to make decisions based on informed intuition, while policy
analysts tend to emphasize technical issues. This software program provides a
relatively rapid method for analyzing and managing the politics of
policymaking. PolicyMaker makes political analysis both accessible and
enjoyable. PolicyMaker<i></i>provides what you need as a policymaker and a
policy analyst: a logical and formal procedure to analyze the political
dimensions of policy change and a systematic method to design effective
strategies for managing the politics.</p>

<p>PolicyMaker is a form of Computer-Assisted Political Analysis (CAPA). The
software can be applied to any policy problem that involves multiple players
with diverging interests. Just as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) assists
architects in the design of effective buildings, CAPA helps political
analysts in the design of effective policies. In the same way that CAD tools
do not tell architects <i>what</i> they want to build, PolicyMaker does not
tell you what kind of policy is right or good. PolicyMaker assists you in
assessing whether your policy is politically feasible, and suggests ways to
make your policy more politically acceptable.</p>

<p>The name PolicyMaker indicates who will find this software useful. Anyone
who is concerned with policy, broadly defined, and with policymakers, in all
spheres, should find value in the software's analytical method and outputs.
The method is applicable to policy issues in the public domain (such as the
mega-policies of national economic policy and health policy) and also in the
private sector (such as the corporate policies of re-engineering and
downsizing). PolicyMaker<i></i>helps you analyze the political dimensions of
your particular policy and helps you visualize the impacts of different
strategies on your policy's future. PolicyMaker helps you win your battles on
the policy field.</p>
<h2><a id="polh4fle"></a>How PolicyMaker Can Help You</h2>

<p>PolicyMaker<i></i>can help you in three main ways. It can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe the political dimensions of a policy decision,<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>explain how a policy decision was made in the past; and <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>design effective strategies for influencing a policy's feasibility</li>
</ul>

<p>As a descriptive tool, PolicyMaker provides a method for collecting and
organizing important political information that will affect the fate of your
policy. Many policy problems involve a degree of complexity that can
overwhelm your capacity to keep the issues well organized in your mind.</p>

<p>PolicyMaker helps you collect and organize descriptive information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Issue definition and Trend Analysis<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Key Players: Position and Power<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Policy Consequences<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Interests of Players<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Coalitions of Players<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Opportunities and Obstacles to Change</li>
</ul>

<p>In many situations, this political information may be well known to people
involved in a policy, but the data are rarely collected or organized
systematically. PolicyMaker provides a set of techniques for deciding on the
information to collect and for displaying that information in ways that are
analytically useful, visually pleasing, and easy to manipulate.</p>

<p>As an explanatory tool, PolicyMaker can help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explain how a particular policy was decided in the past<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>explain which strategies were effective in a particular political
environment</li>
</ul>

<p>The policy science literature is full of theoretical models that seek to
explain how policy decisions should be made (from a normative perspective)
and how such decisions are actually made (from an empirical perspective).
PolicyMaker provides a practical model to explain policymaking processes in a
real world setting. The PolicyMaker model proposes that policy feasibility is
a function of three main factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <i>number of players</i> mobilized to support and oppose a
policy<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>the <i>power</i> of each mobilized player<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>the <i>position</i> and intensity of commitment for each mobilized
player</li>
</ul>

<p>Applied retrospectively, the PolicyMaker method can help you understand
how these three factors shaped the feasibility of a particular policy
decision, or how a specific strategy worked in certain political
circumstances. By examining the strategies that facilitated or blocked the
acceptance of past policies, you can build up your own set of strategies for
future action.</p>

<p>Third, PolicyMaker is a prescriptive tool--to help you design and select
strategies of influence. PolicyMaker<i></i>can help you to: </p>

<p><i>Choose an effective political strategy for:</i> </p>
<ul>
<li>formulating a policy, and <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>implementing a policy</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Improve the political feasibility of your policy by:</i> </p>
<ul>
<li>identifying current supporters and opponents<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>identifying potential supporters<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>analyzing the effects of potential strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>PolicyMaker can help you design
strategies for producing change. The PolicyMaker method is a practical
technique to analyze and change the factors that affect the feasibility of
your policy. The software helps you manage the complexity of real world
problems. In short, this program helps you get what you want--by improving
your political skills and enhancing the political feasibility of your
policy.</p>
<h2><a id="polh4flf"></a>The Four Steps of PolicyMaker Analysis</h2>

<p>PolicyMaker guides you through four steps of applied political analysis
for generating practical strategies on managing the politics of policymaking.
These four steps correspond to the first four main buttons on the <a
href="#polh4lx2">Main Menu screen</a>. You can follow these steps in a
linear fashion (from one to four), or start with later steps and jump around.
However, some steps (such as Impacts) require that a previous step be
completed (such as Strategies) before you can carry out the analysis. The
program advises you of these sequential requirements, as needed.</p>

<p><a href="#polh8abc"><i>Step One--Policy</i></a></p>

<p>In this step, you identify details associated with the issue or goals of the policy.</p>

<p><a href="#polh4ve8"><i>Step Two--Players</i></a></p>

<p>Next, you identify the major players involved in the policy, including
each player's position and power. 
These basic political data can then be displayed in a Position
Map and a Feasibility Graph (based on an algorithm that
calculates a feasibility index of supporters, non-mobilized players, and
opponents). You then assess the policy's consequences for major players and
identify the main interests of each player. You also evaluate the linkages
among major players by building a Coalition Map.</p>

<p><a href="#polh51ps"><i>Step Three--Strategies</i></a></p>

<p>In this step, based on previously entered data, PolicyMaker helps you design strategies to improve the policy's
feasibility and evaluate the probabilities of success. First, you identify
opportunities and obstacles to change, including transitions underway in the
organization responsible for implementing the policy, in the general
organizational environment, and in the broader political environment.
Strategies are then defined, either based on a suggested strategy, or entered
directly.</p>

<p><a href="#polh54vk"><i>Step Four--Impacts</i></a></p>

<p>Finally, you assess each strategy's likely impacts on the power and
position of major players. PolicyMaker uses this information to
calculate the aggregate impacts of a strategy, and to display a
comparison of current and future feasibility. This feature allows you to
visualize alternative future scenarios. Once strategies are designed,
the program can be used to monitor the implementation of strategies and
compare observed and expected impacts.</p>

<h2><a id="polh4flg"></a>Potential Uses of PolicyMaker</H2>

<P>As a rapid assessment tool for political analysis, PolicyMaker can be applied in a variety of ways and settings.  Here are five possible approaches for applying PolicyMaker: </P>

<UL>
<LI><I>Gathering and organizing political data about a particular policy</I>
<P>This is the most common way to use PolicyMaker: as a tool for gathering and organizing information about a proposed policy, especially in complex circumstances with many players.  This approach can help you decide what kind of data to collect about a difficult decision, and allows you to sort and display this information efficiently.  You can create separate files for the same policy at different points in time, to show how the political conditions have changed.  At a minimum, PolicyMaker<I> </I>can function as a policy database.
</LI>

<LI><I>Providing instruction for staff analysis</I>
<P>You can use PolicyMaker as a guide for your staff members, as a way to structure their analytic work.  Staff members can use the program to collect and enter information about a policy, and the program can be used for briefing senior policymakers about important specific problems or strategies.  Another possible approach is for junior staff members to enter basic data, so that senior policymakers can use the program to carry out more sophisticated analysis.
</LI>

<LI><I>Presentations about policy decisions</I>
<P>PolicyMaker can be used in public or small-group settings, to make a presentation about a policy decision or about a set of policy options and their different obstacles and consequences.  In this approach, PolicyMaker<I> </I>is used to present the results of a completed analysis, for consideration by a group of decisionmakers.
</LI>

<LI><I>Strategic planning exercise for groups</I>
<P>PolicyMaker can also be used in a group as an instrument for strategic planning and consensus building among key players, using a skilled facilitator to guide the discussion according to the program's four steps.  In this approach, the program creates a set of shared analytic concepts that guides the group's understanding and analysis of the policy.
</LI>

<LI><I>Confidential advice for top policymakers</I>
<P>PolicyMaker can also be used as a confidential advisory tool for senior policymakers, who may wish to have an explicit analysis of the supporters and opponents of particular policies or decisions.  In this approach, the data, the analysis, and the proposed strategies remain private, and provide an additional analytic input to the decision at hand.
</LI>
</UL>

<h2><a id="polh4flh"></a>Who Should Use PolicyMaker?</H2>

<P>PolicyMaker should be used by anyone who wishes to influence public or private policy decisions that involve multiple groups with diverging interests.  Potential users include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>government policymakers with substantial control and resources and who wish to improve the political feasibility of a proposed policy, <BR><BR></LI>

<LI>non-governmental organizations that have limited influence and resources and seek to promote a specific policy on the official agenda,<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>government officials who seek to increase the loyalty of groups to a proposed policy,<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>groups with little formal influence who wish to increase their voice in the policymaking process,<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>technical analysts who wish that their reports could have more impact on policymakers,<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>individuals within an organization who seek more influence over restructuring efforts,<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>private organizations that seek to manage public issues and multiple organizations in a public or private arena, and<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>groups or individuals such as academic researchers, independent policy analysts, and journalists who study and report on political issues and events.</LI>
</UL>

<P>PolicyMaker could be used by both the supporters and the opponents of a single policy, and they should arrive at different strategies.  You can also use PolicyMaker<I> </I>from the perspective of the other side, to gain insight into their likely strategies and actions.</P>

<P>Because of the diverging potential users and the sensitive data contained in an analysis, all documents and computer files related to a PolicyMaker analysis should be treated with caution and discretion.  A PolicyMaker report designed to assist a specific organization may not be appropriate for public dissemination.  Indeed, in some cases, public distribution could have embarrassing and counterproductive consequences.</P>

<h2><a id="polh4fli"></a>Expected Products of PolicyMaker</H2>

<P>PolicyMaker can create a number of different products, depending on what you need and what you want.  The main products are the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><I>Rapid identification of problems (problem identification)</I>
<P>PolicyMaker can help identify obstacles to the policy, including groups or individuals who oppose the policy, the motivations of the opposition, and policy goals or mechanisms that are not widely accepted.
</LI>

<LI><I>Improved communication among organizations (process)</I>
<P>PolicyMaker can provide better information about the positions and motivations of other groups and organizations, and better flow of information among groups.  One of the most important products of a PolicyMaker<I> </I>analysis is the enhanced ability to view a problem from the perspective of other players.
</LI>

<LI><I>New strategies and ideas for policymakers (output)</I>
<P>The PolicyMaker method offers expert assistance in suggesting strategies on how to change the positions of opposing groups, how to mobilize potential supporters, how to enhance the power of supporters, and how to change public images associated with particular decisions.  This feature can improve the strategic thinking and options considered by policymakers.
</LI>

<LI><I>A repository for information related to a political problem (database)</I>
<P>The PolicyMaker system can be used to construct an ongoing record of information related to a political problem or policy.  This database can be an important resource for groups involved in negotiations that occur in complex environments, with large degrees of uncertainty, and with the potential for either high costs or high gains.
</LI>

<LI><I>Improved political feasibility of policy (outcome)</I>
<P>The ultimate test of PolicyMaker is whether the new strategies and ideas generated through the analysis can enhance the political feasibility of a desired policy.  The program includes a tracking feature that allows you to monitor implementation and compare observed impacts and expected impacts for a set of strategies.
</LI>
</UL>

<h2><a id="polh4flj"></a>How to Carry Out a PolicyMaker Analysis</h2>

<p>PolicyMaker provides a series of tables that are logically arranged to
describe the processes that influence a policy. One way to carry out a
PolicyMaker analysis involves the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Write down a clear definition of the policy</i>
<p>This definition of your policy may change as you carry out the
analysis and design your strategies, but it is important to start with as
clear a statement as possible. Indeed, you may decide to change some
elements of your policy in order to improve its feasibility. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Find a willing and enthusiastic policymaker</i>
<p>In some cases, you are the policymaker (the person who will use the
analysis). In other cases, you are performing PolicyMaker for a client
who is a policymaker and who may not have time to enter the data but
wants to use the results. The client can help you by providing important
background information on the policy as well as introductions to major
players (if interviews are to be used). The client can also help you
define the policy. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Carry out a preliminary analysis</i>
<p>Use available documents and knowledgeable individuals to complete a
preliminary PolicyMaker analysis. Identify the major players involved in
the policy, and suggest individuals to be interviewed. This preliminary
analysis should indicate areas for additional data collection. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Conduct interviews with major players</i>
<p>If possible, interview major players.  In some circumstances (for example, when a confidential
analysis is being undertaken), you will not conduct interviews. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Provide feedback to the policymaker</i>
<p>If you are not the policymaker, then you need to find an effective way
to present the results of PolicyMaker to your client. You can print a
complete HTML report your PolicyMaker exercise for a presentation, or you
can use your computer screen to present the analysis and your
conclusions. For these presentations, it is helpful to prepare a brief
written analysis for the four main steps of PolicyMaker, to interpret and
summarize the main points. Note that many word processing and spreadsheet
tools allow copying from your internet browser's display of the HTML
report. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps for carrying out a PolicyMaker analysis work well for an
application with an individual analyst and a policymaker client. The steps
will need adapting for other types of applications, such as confidential
assessments, group discussions, and strategic planning exercises.</p>
<h2><a id="polh4flk"></a>Potential Risks of PolicyMaker</H2>

<P>PolicyMaker also involves some risks.  In some situations, efforts to carry out PolicyMaker may have unintended consequences.  The exercise: </P>

<UL>
<LI><I>Can generate controversy</I>
<P>PolicyMaker can generate controversy, especially if some participants see their interests threatened or if you are perceived as partisan or biased.
</LI>

<LI><I>Can make explicit the interests of organizations</I>
<P>If the analysis is perceived as identifying the interests and agendas of organizations and individuals, some pressure may be directed against you to influence your analysis.
</LI>

<LI><I>Can sometimes make consensus more difficult</I>
<P>If significant conflict develops from a PolicyMaker<I> </I>analysis, the controversy could make it more difficult to achieve consensus on a policy.
</LI>

<LI><I>Can become biased from the values of the analyst or the client</I>
<P>PolicyMaker involves a risk of bias from your values or the client's values or the data sources, because some data require judgment and interpretation.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>In short, PolicyMaker is not foolproof.  Each step requires careful consideration of potential bias and appropriate consultation with the client and other individuals to reduce uncertainty and bias.  One way to minimize these risks is to carry out PolicyMaker in a team that includes "insiders" and "outsiders", to provide a local interpretation of the context along with new ideas and external perspectives.   Do not confuse your completed analysis with reality.  The analysis depends on your judgments about players and their influence and positions, on your assessments of the impacts of specific strategies on players, and on the program's assumptions about interactions among strategies and among players.</P>

<P>Remember, your opponent shares your objective of "winning" and is making an opposing set of political calculations.  While most good politicians make these calculations on an intuitive basis, PolicyMaker makes these political calculations explicit, helping you learn how to win in political competition.  There is an additional risk here.  Some people may be more successful with their intuitive sense than with explicit analysis.  If you are one of these natural politicians, then you don't need PolicyMaker.  The rest of us need PolicyMaker, and must learn to handle the risks associated with its use.</P>

<P>Finally, it is important to remember that PolicyMaker does not tell you if a policy is right from an ethical perspective.  PolicyMaker is designed to help you get what you want.  It does not tell you whether what you want is right or fair.  Each user of PolicyMaker, therefore, needs to analyze the ethical issues associated with a policy, in addition to examining the politics.  Managing the political dimensions of a decision does not substitute for assuring the ethical basis of a policy.</P>

<h2><a id="polh4fll"></a>Applications of PolicyMaker</H2>

<P>PolicyMaker has been field tested around the world in diverse political environments and has been used to train hundreds of policymakers and policy analysts.  Additional improvements no doubt could be made to the method and the manual.  The software program has been designed to allow you substantial flexibility in adapting the method to your particular circumstances and preferences.  We encourage users to contact us with their ideas and suggestions.</P>

<P>Here is a sample of field situations where PolicyMaker has been used:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Partnership for Child Development in Ghana<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>National Health Reform in Mexico and several other Latin American countries<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>Health of the City Program in Cambridge, Massachusetts<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>Essential Health Interventions Project in Tanzania<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>School Children's Health Insurance in Egypt<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>Pharmaceutical Policy Reform in eight developing countries<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>Reproductive Health Policy in Tanzania</LI>
</UL>

<P>Although PolicyMaker was not used by the Clinton Administration for the US Health Reform Effort, we have prepared an analysis of this reform effort as an illustrative example for the tool and this help text, to demonstrate how to use the software program.</P>

1.3, 2.0 - 2.3 and during the beta test period provided invaluable help in
identifying areas for improvement and ideas for enhancement.  Comments provided by users of PolicyMaker 4.0 have also been very helpful.</p>

<h2><a id="polh4lwx"></a>Starting PolicyMaker</h2>

<p>When you first access PolicyMaker, the
<i>Welcome to PolicyMaker</i> or select project view is displayed.</p>

<p>The last project you worked on will be listed as the 'Current' choice. To
resume work on your last project, click on <i>Current</i>.</p>

<p>The Welcome screen also offers other choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open the <i>Example</i> project</p></li> 
<li><p><a href="#polh4lwz"><i>Create</i></a> a new project.</p></li>
<li><p>Import a file from your computer into local storage</p></li>
<li><p>Export a file from local storage to your computer</p></li>
<li><p>Projects - view a list of projects in local storage</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When you first start using PolicyMaker 5, please review the limitations and nature of the default local storage feature.  
Please see the section on <a href="#faq">Saving Data</a></p>

<h2><a id="polh4lwy"></a>What is a Project?</h2>

<p>When you use PolicyMaker, you will be working on a particular "Project." A
project is the largest division of data for the PolicyMaker system. A given
project contains a variety of tables, maps and other information. Just as a
word processing system focuses on a particular document--a letter or an
article, for instance--each time you use PolicyMaker you will select a
particular project file to work on.</p>

<p>It is
relatively difficult to move data from one project file to another. Store all
your information about a particular policy or initiative in a single project.
If you divide your data into different projects you may find it difficult to
combine the data later.</p>

<p>When you export a project to your hard disk, all project file names end with the suffix ".JSON."
A PolicyMaker file is formatted as a Javascript Object Notation file. Consequently, it can be viewed in
a tool such as Notepad. Do not edit a PolicyMaker file outside the program,
as the program may find the file unreadable if key information is changed.</p>

<p>In addition to the data you enter about players, issues, and strategies,
your project contains certain information about your project, such as the
analyst name and lists. See <a href="#polh9nqo">Summary and Settings</a> for
more information on project-based data.</p>

<h2><a id="polh4lwz"></a>Creating a New Project</h2>

<p>To create a new project, click on <i>Create</i> on the <i>Welcome</i>
window. The system will display the <i>Add New Project</i> dialog box which asks for the name you want to
call your project, plus a variety of other attributes. This
is where you define the title for your project and enter your name or the
name of the analyst. The project name and analyst are required, other fields are optional.</p>

<p>The fields on this box can be edited later.  See the <a href="#polh9qwg"><b>Project Settings</b></a> display 
for detailed information about each of the fields on this box.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><a id="polh4lx1"></a>Opening a Project File</h2>

<p>If you want to open a project that is not your 'Current' project, click on the <i>Projects</i> 
button on the <i>Welcome</i> screen.  The <i>Local Projects</i> box will be displayed.  This box provides a listing 
of your current Local Storage projects and an estimate of how
much local storage has been used.  Click on the <i>Open</i> button to open a project.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> When you first use the system, no prior projects will be
listed.</p>


<h2><a id="polh4lx2"></a>The Main Menu Screen</h2>

<p>Once you have started a new project or selected a pre-existing one, the
Main Menu screen is displayed. This screen is shown whenever you have opened
a project and no other main window is displayed. It is not shown until you
either create a new project or open an existing one. </p>

<p>The five boxes on this screen correspond to the four steps in the
methodology plus one box for Summary and Settings. To learn more about the
four steps, see <a href="#polh4p2p">How the Method and Program Work
Together</a>. </p>

<p>To display a main step, click on icon for the step or on the step name.</p>

<p>For a more detailed explanation of the PolicyMaker method and the meaning
of each table, see the topics on the <a href="#polh4s8g">four steps of the
PolicyMaker method</a></p>

<h2><a id="polh4lx3"></a>The Example Project: Clinton's Health Care
Reform</h2>

<p>PolicyMaker includes a sample PolicyMaker project, Clinton's Health Care
Reform, to illustrate procedures described in the text. The Clinton Health
Care Reform example file is limited--see <a href="#faq">About Saving Data</a>
for more information.</p>

<h2><a id="polh4lx4"></a>Saving Data</h2>

<p><b><i>Automatic Saving</i></b></p>

<p>PolicyMaker saves most of your data to local storage when you click on the <i>OK</i> button
on any detail window or dialog box. When you open a detail window, either to add a row or edit
one, the system will save your data as soon as you click on the <i>OK</i>
button. When the <i>Cancel </i>button is visible, clicking on <i>Cancel</i>
will stop the recently entered data from being saved. </p>

<p>Some displays allow direct input (such as the Coalition Map window).</p>

<p>If you want to copy a table's data to a file--for possible use in other apps--you can use the <a
href="#polh9nqr">Summary</a> feature to create a single-page report. Some editors 
will accept a paste operation from an HTML (web) page.</p>
    
<h2><a id="polh4lx5"></a>Leaving PolicyMaker</h2>

<p>When you open a project or initiate the <i>Create</i> process,
any project you currently have open is automatically closed. Projects are
also automatically closed when navigate to another web page or use the browser's back or next button, or enter an address
or search in the browser's address box.</p>

<p>You should export your data frequently.  See the topic on <a href="#faq">Saving Data</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="polh4yk1"></a>Help</h2>

<p>To access help, click on the <i>Help</i> button on the toolbar.  The Help button should open a separate tab in Chrome.
In some cases, due to pop-up blockers, the help button may fail to load the Help tab.  In that case, navigate to 
<a href="help.html">help.html</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="polh4p2p"></a>How the Method and Program Work Together</h2>

<p>The PolicyMaker method is based on four analytical steps--issues, players,
strategies, and impacts of strategies. Each step has a corresponding main
step screen in the program. See the <a href="#polh4flf">Four Steps of
PolicyMaker Analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Each of the four main steps has a variety of sub-steps, or main windows.
When you select <i>2. Players</i> from the <em>Main
Menu</em> window, PolicyMaker will main step panel showing buttons and
descriptions for the sub-steps related to Players. </p>

<p>For example, the button for Players briefly describes what you do
to complete that step. Each sub-step has a clickable box on the panel
for <em>Players</em>. The text displayed next to each button provides a concise
summary of that step. </p>

<p>For more information about each of the detailed steps, consult the
appropriate help topic on the step. See the topic on <a
href="#polh4s8g">The PolicyMaker Method</a> for a menu to topics on the
main steps.</p>

<p>You can return to the <em>Main Menu</em> at any time by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on the <i>Up</i> button on the toolbar until you return to the Main Menu</li>
<li>Selecting Main Menu from the accordion-style Menu accessible from the <i>Menu</i> button</li>
</ul>

<p>To return to a sub-step window, click on the <i>Up</i> button on the
toolbar. The corresponding main step panel will then be displayed. </p>

<p>Here's an outline of PolicyMaker's structure. Each step is numbered, and
each sub-step has a letter:</p>

<h2><a id="polh4p2q"></a>Entering Data: Issue, Players, Strategies,
and Impacts</h2>

<p>When you analyze a policy or political situation with PolicyMaker, you are
entering and manipulating data on three basic components: </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Policy:</i> Define an issue and key policy and program interventions, and <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><i>Players:</i> The people, organizations, parts of organizations, and
social groups who play a role in determining the feasibility of your
policy, and<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><i>Strategies:</i> The actions you can take to enhance your policy's
feasibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>A PolicyMaker analysis builds on these three components, to assess your
policy's feasibility under different conditions.</p>

<p>Once you have entered basic data on the issue, the players, and the
strategies, you can analyze how these components relate to each other, by
entering data on: </p>
<ul>
<li>Players' interests, and how players relate to each other,<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Opportunities and obstacles relating to players and the political
environment, and<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>How strategies might change the power or position of players--what
PolicyMaker calls strategy impacts.</li>
</ul>

<p>The overall goal of PolicyMaker is to improve (or undermine) the political
feasibility of a policy, according to strategies that change the policy or
the players in critical ways. PolicyMaker helps you figure out the factors
that determine feasibility. The program helps you design and evaluate
different strategies, and thereby helps you envision different policy
futures.</p>

<p>All the windows in PolicyMaker relate to the policy, the players, and the
strategies. PolicyMaker includes mechanisms for entering, analyzing, sorting,
relating, and displaying data about these three components. The program is
constructed on a database, and the windows that you see on the screen mimic
the internal "data structure", often in a spreadsheet-like grid of data. In
this format, each row in the grid corresponds to a row in the project's
database.</p>



<h2><a id="polh4p2r"></a>Common Features of PolicyMaker Windows</H2>

<P>Many of the main windows in PolicyMaker share certain common features:</P>

<div class="indentsect">
<P><A HREF="#polh79m9"><B>The Toolbar</B></A></P>

<P><A HREF="#polh79ma"><B>Tables</B></A></P>

</div>
<p></p>

<h2><a id="polh79m9"></a>The Toolbar </h2>

<p>When a main window is displayed, a toolbar appears at the top of the
screen. The following buttons are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Menu</b>: Displays a slide-out menu allowing direct access to the main windows of the application.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Up</b>: Return to the step menu for the current screen. Thus, if the
Players table is displayed, <em>Up</em> returns to the Player Menu.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Help:</b> Displays the Help screen.  See <a href="#polh4yk1">Help</a>
</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="polh79ma"></a>Tables </h2>

<p>Many of the main windows and a few of the detail windows display tables.
One useful feature of the tables in PolicyMaker is the ability to sort the
rows, according to different criteria. For instance, on the Player Table, you
can sort the entries by their <i>Position</i> with respect to the policy.
This allows you to see your opponents and your supporters grouped separately.
Seeing all your opponents together might help suggest strategies for specific
players or might help you assess the overall feasibility of your policy.</p>

<p>You can sort any table by clicking on the heading<i></i>for the column to
sort on. Sorting makes no permanent change to the database--it simply
displays the data in the selected order. </p>

<p>Many of the tables have a context menu.  The context menu can be accessed
by right-clicking a row in the table.  When you right-click a row, the row will be
selected, and the following choices may be available on the row:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Add:</b> Initiates the addition of a row to a table.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Edit:</b> Click on this to edit the current row in a table. PolicyMaker
will display the appropriate detail window. To use Edit, a row must be
selected.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Delete:</b> Initiates the deletion of a row from a table. To use
Delete, a row must be selected.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Increase Row Height:</b> Temporarily increases the row height for the table.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Decrease Row Height:</b> Temporarily decreases the row height for the table.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If a table supports adding rows, an <i>Add</i> button will appear in the heading section for the window.</p>


<h2><a id="polh4p2s"></a>Using Table and Detail Windows: An
Example--The Player Table</h2>

<p>Many PolicyMaker users prefer to start with the Player Table. The Player
Table's entries are used in other windows in the analysis, so it is advisable
to identify the key players early in a project. The Player Table is also a
good example of the main tables of the system and has many features found in
other tables.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong></p>

<div class="indentsect">
<p><a href="#polh7cs1"><b>Example: The Player Table</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh7cs2"><b>Sorting the Player Table</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh7cs3"><b>Adding a Player: Using The Player Detail
Window</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh7cs5"><b>Navigating Between Players</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh7cs6"><b>Deleting a Player</b></a></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="polh7cs1"></a>Example: The Player Table</h2>

<p>To access the player table, click on the <i>Player Table</i> button on the
Player panel.</p>

<p>For a new project, the Player Table screen will initially be blank. You
cannot edit information or add players directly on the Player Table. You must
access the Player detail window to add a player. This is true with many other
tables in PolicyMaker.</p>

<p>Each row in the Player Table refers to a particular person, organization,
part of an organization, or social group. Each column describes a different
facet of information about the player. Two columns, <i>Position</i> and
<i>Power</i>, code information about each entry by color. In the
<i>Power</i> column, for instance, the color black indicates that the
player has high power with respect to the policy at hand. Sorting by
<i>Power</i> will cause all the black-coded players to appear near the
top of the table.</p>

<p>To add a player, click on the <em>Add</em> button on the toolbar.</p>

<h2><a id="polh7cs2"></a>Sorting the Player Table</h2>

<p>The Player Table (like many other tables in PolicyMaker) supports
sorting--it allows you to sort all the entries by a certain attribute (see <a
href="#polh79ma">Tables</a>). Click on a column heading at
the top of the screen to request sorting by a particular attribute. </p>

<p>Try sorting your players by <i>Position</i>. This will order all players
from those who strongly support your policy to those who most oppose your
policy. This may suggest alliances, or may suggest strategies aimed at a
group of players who share a common position on your policy.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can sort the players by <i>Sector</i>. This may suggest
how different classes of players share common positions--or radically differ
in their positions.</p>

<h2><a id="polh7cs3"></a>Adding a Player: Using The Player Detail
Window</h2>

<p>To create a player, click on the <i>Add</i> button. The Add Player window
will be displayed.</p>

<p>When the Add Player window is displayed, other windows cannot be accessed.
To exit without changing anything, click on the <i>Cancel</i> button in the
lower right corner of the display.</p>

<p>The Add Player window has a variety of fields you can fill in. Each dialog box has different requirements.  
If you click on <i>OK</i> and a required value is missing or invalid, an orange message will appear on the box.
You may always click <i>Cancel</i> to exit the box.</p>

<p>The <i>Player Name</i> must be no longer than 70 characters. In addition,
you cannot add two players with <i>exactly</i> the same name. Inadvertent
duplicate entries are not entirely blocked by the system, however. It is
possible to add two players, one named "Dole, Sen. <i>Robert</i>" and the
other named "Dole, Sen. <i>Bob,</i>" for example.</p>

<p><i>Hint:</i> You may want to enter the names of players in a way that will
allow you to sort them usefully. "Dole, Sen. Robert" or "Sen. Dole" might
both be more useful while "Robert Dole, Sen." would not be as useful (unless
you are interested in sorting by the Player's first names).</p>

<p>To complete the addition of the player, click on the <i>OK</i> button.
This will return you to the Player Table. The player that was just added
will be highlighted and selected as the current player. Not all the
information on the Player detail window is shown in the table, only the items
considered to be most important.</p>

<h2><a id="polh7cs4"></a>Editing and Viewing Detail Player Data</h2>

<p>From the Player Table, right-click on the player's row in the table to see the detail window
for an existing player. (You can click anywhere on the row, not just on the
player's <i>Name</i>.) The Player detail window will be displayed.</p>

<p>The Player detail window is the same as the Add Player window, except that
all the fields are filled with data already on file for the entry. You can
change any data on the player, including the name. However, you cannot change
the name of the player to that of another player.</p>

<p>To exit the Player detail window without saving the data, click on
<i>Cancel</i>. To keep your changes, click on <i>OK</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="polh7cs5"></a>Navigating Between Players</h2>

<p>When the Player Table is displayed, one row is marked as the current
player. This is the player whose row appears with a blue background in the
table.</p>

<p>Clicking once on a row makes it the current player.</p>

<p>When displaying the detail window for an existing player, the
<em>Next</em> and <em>Previous</em> buttons change the current player to the
next or the previous player in the table.</p>

<h2><a id="polh7cs6"></a>Deleting a Player</h2>

<p>Deleting a player is done on the Player Table. Right-click on a player row, and 
select the <i>Delete</i> option from the context menu.  You will then be prompted with 
a confirmation box.  Click on <i>OK</i> to delete, or <i>Cancel</i> to exit without
deleting.</p>

<h2><a id="polh4s8g"></a>The Four Steps of the PolicyMaker Method</h2>

<p><a href="#polh6lip">Where to Start</a>: A look at the method and how to
apply it to your policy or political problem.</p>

<p>The four steps:</p>

<div class="indentsect">
<p><a href="#polh8abc"><b>Step 1: Policy</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh4ve8"><b>Step 2: Players</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh51ps"><b>Step 3: Strategies</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh54vk"><b>Step 4: Impacts</b></a></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="polh6lip"></a>Where to Start?</h2>

<p>PolicyMaker requires that you perform four main analytic steps, which
require different kinds of skills (see <a href="#polh4flf">The Four Steps
of PolicyMaker</a>). How should you carry out these four steps? A linear
thinker would view these four steps as sequential--that is, first you define
your issues, then you analyze the players on the political terrain, next you
design your strategies, and finally you assess the likely impacts of your
strategies--one, two, three, four. Many models of policymaking assume this
neat sequential series of steps. Reality, however, is much messier. </p>

<p>When you use PolicyMaker you do not have to follow this straight line of
four steps. Our experience suggests that you should approach PolicyMaker as
an iterative process. Begin where you feel comfortable and with what you know
best. Many analysts start with the Player Table, identifying the key actors
involved in a policy, and then moving to other tables. You will probably
revise your ideas and your tables as you carry out interviews and think about
the data you are collecting. </p>

<p>Of course, if you feel comfortable with linear thinking, then follow the
four main analytical steps one-by-one: the issue, players, strategies, and
then impacts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<h2><a id="polh8abc"></a>Policy (Step 1)</h2>

<p>In this step, you identify the key issues associated
with your policy, the expected result of the implementation of your policy,
and any indicator that could be used to evaluate these results. </p>

<p>For each issue, the following data is collected: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Name</em>: Specify the issue clearly in a sentence or two.</li>
<li><em>Mechanism</em>: Describe a concrete goal associated with this issue,
if implemented.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Indicator</em>: How can you measure whether each expected result is
achieved? Here you should identify one or two specific indicators for
each issue.  <br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="polh4ve8"></a>Players (Step 2)</h2>

<p>In this step, you identify the major players involved in the policy,
including each player's position and power. </p>

<p>These basic political data can then be displayed in a Position
Map and a Feasibility Graph (based on an algorithm that
calculates a feasibility index of supporters, non-mobilized players, and
opponents). You then assess the policy's consequences for major players and
identifies the main interests of each player. You also evaluate the linkages
among major players (in the Coalition Map).</p>

<p>Any assessment of political feasibility must examine the players and must
make informed judgments about the players. But, unfortunately, the field of
policy analysis does not have a single or simple method for evaluating
political players. PolicyMaker therefore includes a number of analytical
methods to assess the players involved in your policy. In particular, you
will be asked to judge the positions, power, and number of players, as
well as their interests and their relationships.</p>

<p>Substeps:</p>

<div class="indentsect">
<p><a href="#polh4ve9"><b>Player Table (Step 2A)</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh4vea"><b>Position Map - Current (Step 2B)</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh4veb"><b>Feasibility Graph - Current (Step 2C)</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh4vec"><b>Consequences Table (Step 2D)</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh4ved"><b>Interests Table (Step 2E)</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh4vef"><b>Coalition Map(Step 2F)</b></a></p>
</div>

<h2><a id="polh4ve9"></a>Player Table (Step 2A)</h2>

<p>The Player Table is one of the core tables in PolicyMaker. This table
identifies all the players that might be affected by or might affect your
policy, and assesses their power and their position on the policy. In
this table, you enter information on who is for and who is against your
policy, and who has yet to take a position, and you enter your qualitative
assessment of the strength of a player's support or opposition. </p>

<p>The Player Table shows basic information about the players in your
project. The list of players should include all major groups that might be
affected by the policy, even if the group is not organized or mobilized. You
should also consider differences <i>within</i> an organization, since
sub-units and individuals may take different positions from the overall
organization.</p>

<p>The fields shown on the Player detail window can be divided into two
categories: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#polh6a29">Identification fields</a>,<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><a href="#polh6a2a">Fields associated with players' positions or
power</a>, <br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="polh6a29"></a>Players: Identification Fields</h2>

<p>To create an entry for a player, you must provide the name and an
abbreviation (recommended: up-to-eight characters) for the player. The <i>Player Type</i>
and <i>Sector</i> fields are not required, but appear on the Player Table and
are useful in analyzing the players.</p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Player</i>: When typing in the name of a player, consider placing
the more important information first, thus making the <i>Sort by Name</i>
feature more useful.
<p></p>
</li>
<li><i>Player Abbreviations</i>: <i>Player Abbreviations</i> are used by
the Position and Coalition Maps to represent player positions. If the map
does not have space for the full name, it will use the abbreviation. If
no abbreviation is given, the first eight characters of the name are used
as the abbreviation.
<p></p>
</li>
<li><i>Sector of Player</i>: When you enter details on a player, you should
choose a sector to which the player belongs. Select one of the listed
options or enter your own text value. Note: If you wish to create your
own list of choices for this field, see <a
href="#polh9qwg">Project Settings</a>.
<p></p>
</li>
<li><em>Level</em>: Identify the level of the player. By default, the
selection is between National, Regional and Local. To change the
selection for your project, display the <a
href="#polh9qwg">Project Settings</a> window.
<p></p>
</li>
<li><em>Additional Player Information</em>: Use this field to provide
further qualitative information about the player.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="polh6a2a"></a>Players: Feasibility Algorithm Fields</h2>

<p>The first data you enter for a player is your assessment of the player's
position and power with respect to the policy. PolicyMaker provides
several methods to assess a player's power and position. The
<i>Position</i> and <i>Power</i> fields are used by <a
href="#polh58tu">the feasibility algorithm</a> to calculate feasibility
indices. The Player detail window displays a scrollbar to set these values. 
Your responses will be shown through the color displayed in
the <i>Position</i> and <i>Power Indicators</i>.</p>

<p><i>Position and Power controls:</i> </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Position of Player</i>
<p>The position of a player, as shown in the Player Table, combines a
player's position (support, opposition, or non-mobilized) and the
strength of that position (high, medium, or low)--leading to seven
possible positions (one non-mobilized position, and three degrees of
support or opposition). Whether a player is a supporter, opponent, or
non-mobilized for a particular policy should be determined from an
analysis of documents, public statements, and interviews. The degree of
support or opposition can be assessed according to the level of resources
committed to a policy position (including, for example, financial
resources, personnel time, and public statements).  The positions of all players can be
displayed and printed in the <a href="#polh4vea">Position Map</a>.
Deciding on a player's position can require an interpretation of
ambiguous evidence, and you can record those ambiguities and sources of
data in the Note window accessible from the Player detail screen. You may
also decide to revise the position and the strength of position as you
collect more data. Positions may change over time and with respect to
different elements or mechanisms within the policy. Players' positions
can be displayed alone or combined with their power in the
Feasibility Graph. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Power of Player</i>
<p>How much power does a particular player have over the outcome of a
policy debate? The program allows you to select: high, medium, or low.
 A player with high
power generally has substantial influence over whether a policy will
be adopted or implemented, but not total power. Similarly, a player
with low power is relatively powerless, but still has some
possibility to influence a policy. PolicyMaker can be used to assist a player with high
power determine how to get her way, as well as to help a powerless
player design strategies to have more influence on a decision. Players'
power values can be displayed alone or combined with their positions
in the Feasibility Graph. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="polh4vea"></a>Position Map - Current (Step 2B)</h2>

<p>The Position Map displays each player's position on the policy along a
continuum of support to opposition, with high support at the far left (dark
green) and high opposition at the far right (dark red). One overall goal of
the program is to design strategies that move players leftward on the
Position Map, thereby increasing support for the policy and making it more
politically feasible (assuming that you want the policy).</p>

<p>The following Position Maps in are available in PolicyMaker: </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Position Map - Current</i> (this window): Shows the positions and
power as entered on the Player table.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><a href="#polh54vm"><i>Position Map - Future</i> (Step 5B)</a>:
Shows future positions if specific strategies or strategy packages are
implemented.<br>
<br>
</li>

</ul>

<p>The Position Map shows all players with defined positions. Players for
whom no position is set are not displayed. Each player appears as a small
rectangle containing the player's name or abbreviation. In the Position Map,
the color of the box (fill color) indicates the player's level of power
(black for high, gray for medium, and white for low). </p>

<p>For more information about setting a player's positions, see the <a
href="#polh4ve9">Player Table topic</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="polh4veb"></a>Feasibility Graph - Current (Step 2C)</h2>

<p>The Feasibility Graph displays a quantitative assessment of the relative
strength of all supporters versus all opponents, and the potential to
mobilize players currently in the non-mobilized category. The assessment is
based on the assumption that political feasibility is determined by three
main factors: </p>
<ul>
<li>the strength of the position a player takes (low, medium, or high
support or opposition), <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>the power of a player (high, medium, or low power), and <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>the number of players who are mobilized to support or oppose a policy.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Feasibility Graph displays this information as a bar chart.</p>

<p>The Feasibility Graph assesses the political feasibility of your proposed
policy by calculating a value for each player that combines the <i>Position
<em>and</em> Power</i>. The calculated values for all supporters, all
non-mobilized players, and all opponents are then summed to create an index,
shown as three numbers in the Feasibility Graph..</p>

<p>The Feasibility Graph thus provides a visual display of the relative
strengths of supporters and opponents, and the potential strength of
non-mobilized players. This graph should be interpreted with a degree of
caution, because of qualitative judgments made in assigning power and
position values to players. If the support index greatly exceeds the
opposition index, then you could conclude that the policy has good chances at
feasibility. If the support index and opposition index are at similar levels,
or the opposition index greatly exceeds the support index, then you could
conclude that the policy has poor chances at feasibility, or at least faces
major challenges.</p>

<p>The Feasibility Graph can calculate feasibility indices on current as well
as future positions and power. The Current Feasibility Graph calculates
the feasibility based on current positions (entered in the Player Table),
while the <a href="#polh54vn">Future Feasibility Graph</a> calculates the
expected impacts on position and power if specific strategies are
implemented (as entered in the <a href="#polh54vl">Strategy Impacts</a>
window). The Comparison Feasibility Graph shows both current and future
indices on the same graph.</p>
<h2><a id="polh4vec"></a>Consequences Table (Step 2D)</h2>

<p>PolicyMaker provides an assessment of a policy's consequences along five
dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Type:</i> What type of consequence?<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><i>Identity</i>: Who is affected?<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><i>Size</i>: How much of an effect?<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><i>Timing</i>: When will the effects start?<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><i>Importance</i>: How important are the effects?</li>
</ul>

<p>These five dimensions are used to describe the consequences of the policy.
Estimating these consequences is not easy, and requires either an existing
policy analysis of good quality or good guesswork--or some of both.</p>

<p>The Policy Consequence Table asks you to enter the following kinds of
data:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Type of Consequence</i>
<p>PolicyMaker provides a list of various types of consequences. Select
one of the listed options or enter your own text value. Note: If you wish
to set your own selection of choices for this field, see <a
href="#polh9qwg">Project Settings</a>. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Consequence Description</i>
<p>In this box, provide a brief description of the consequence for the
player that you have selected. This description should provide some more
details for the type of consequence that you selected. You may also want
to describe whether the consequence is obvious and direct or more subtle
and indirect. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Size of the Consequence</i>
<p>How large of a consequence is anticipated? You can respond with
"large" or "small." If possible, quantify the size. For a financial
consequence, estimate the money required. For an administrative
consequence, indicate the number of personnel required, or the size of
the new agency. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Timing of the Consequence</i>
<p>When will the consequence begin? Do you expect the effect to commence
immediately (with the passage of a new law, for example, or with the
implementation of the law)? Or will the consequence occur some time in
the future? Will the consequence be one-time and short-term, or will it
be continuous and long-term? </p>
</li>
<li><i>A Consequence for Whom?</i>
<p>Select the player who is affected by the consequence that you are
considering. PolicyMaker provides a list of all the players that you
named in the Player Table. You may want to enter a given consequence
multiple times--once each for significantly affected players. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Importance of the Consequence</i>
<p>Select the degree of importance for the consequence (high, medium,
low, or unknown), and provide a brief description of the importance, or
why it is difficult to assess the importance. Think of how important the
consequence is to the overall political feasibility of the policy. This
assessment provides a comparative indicator across different
consequences. </p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>How many consequences should you include in this table? You could assess
all seven types of consequences for all listed players, but this probably
would produce more information than you need or could easily grasp. Keep the
entries limited to a reasonable number. The purpose is to identify those
consequences that make a difference to the political feasibility of the
policy, not to identify all possible consequences. For ideas of what the
consequences might be, you can review the mechanisms identified in the
Content Table.</p>
<h2><a id="polh4ved"></a>Interests Table (Step 2E)</h2>

<p>The Interests Table asks you to explain why a player has taken a
particular position (as shown in the Player Table and the Position Map). This
analysis (sometimes called a stakeholder analysis) is important because it
helps explain the motives behind the positions taken, and also because it can
help identify strategies to change a player's position. Be sure to include
the key organizations that appear in the Player Table, especially those that
are highly mobilized in support or opposition, and those that might be
persuaded to change their position or their degree of mobilization. A given
player can have more than one interest.</p>

<p>The Interests Table involves three qualitative assessments about the
players:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Type of Interest</i>
<p>What does the player seek to gain from its position on the policy?
Select one of the listed options or enter your own text value. Note: If
you wish to set your own selection of choices for this field, see <a
href="#polh9qwg">Project Settings</a>. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Priority of Interest</i>
<p>How important (high, medium, or low) is this interest for the player?
The level of priority can be expressed in various ways: the degree of
involvement of leaders, the level of resources committed to promoting the
player's position, or explicit statements about the priority (in
interviews or documents). </p>
</li>
<li><i>Interest (Description)</i>
<p>Describe briefly the player's interest. What do you think motivates
the player to take a particular position? This assessment of "motives"
may rely on ambiguous data and can be subjective. You can use this field
to explain the evidence you used to reach your conclusion about the
motives for a player. You can explain both the types of interests you
selected and the priority that you assigned to each interest. </p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>How many players and how many interests should you enter? Here again,
rather than including all the players assessed for all possible interests,
you should choose those players that are relevant for the policy's
feasibility. In particular, consider any players whose position you might be
able to influence through negotiations or other actions. Note these
possibilities in the <i>Interest Description</i>, so that you can use these
ideas in the Strategy Design step, to help you construct effective strategies
for feasibility.</p>

<p>While completing the Interests Table, you may realize that some
individuals or some units within an organization have different positions or
different interests from the larger organization. Should you add them to the
Player Table? If you think that the individual (or sub-unit) could affect the
policy's outcome in a critical way, then add them as separate players. For
many policies, the individual can make a difference--in getting an issue on
the agenda, in negotiating effective coalitions, in providing important
information, in pushing organizations to follow through on commitments.
Differences in the interests of individuals and the interests of their
organizations also provide opportunities for political strategies to
influence the policy. If you enter this information in the Interest Table,
you can refer to it when you design your strategies.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><a id="polh4vef"></a>Coalition Map (Step 2F)</h2>

<p>The Coalition Map allows you to diagram current (or future) coalitions of
players. Players may hold the same position on a policy, but not belong to a
coalition. This analysis helps you visualize current and potential
coalitions. You can group players together in coalitions, and use the three
concentric circles to represent levels of power or proximity to the
decision.</p>

<p>When the Coalition Map is
first displayed, no players are displayed on it.</p>

<p>To add a player, click the <i>Add</i> button. The <i>Add to the Coalition Map</i> dialog
box will be shown.  On this dialog you can:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a player: Check the <i>Select a player to add...</i> radio button, and select one
of the players from the list.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a caption: Check the <i>Add a caption</i> radio button, and fill in text for a caption</p></li>
<li><p>Create a radial line: Check the <i>Create a coalition divider...</i> radio button, and fill in a value from 0 to 360</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To move a player or a caption, click on the item to select, then drag the mouse to the items's
new location on the map. You can place players with high influence or high access
to decision-makers close to the center of the map; or you can use the three
concentric circles to represent some other value. Place players together who
are current or potential members of coalitions.</p>

<p>Players that are added after you have built your Coalition Map can also be
added via the Add window.</p>

<p>To delete a player, caption, or legend, select the item and click on the
<i>Delete</i> button. A deletion window will be displayed to confirm your
choice. To delete a divider, click on the <i>Delete</i> button and select the
divider from the list. Deleting here does not completely delete the player --
it only removes the player from the display.</p>

<p>To add concentric circles to the diagram, click the <i>Options</i> button and radii values. Radii values are
a percentage of the image height.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2><a id="polh51ps"></a>Strategies (Step 3)</h2>

<p>In the third step, based on previously entered data, PolicyMaker
 helps you design strategies to improve the policy's
feasibility and evaluate the probabilities of success. </p>

<p>Substeps:</p>

<div class="indentsect">
<p><a href="#polh4yk3"><b>Opportunities and Obstacles (Step 3A)</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh51pt"><b>Suggested Strategies (Step 3B)</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh51pv"><b>Strategy Table (Step 3C)</b></a> </p>
</div>
<p></p>

<p>Before starting the process of entering strategies, you may want to review
information you entered on prior screens for relevance in strategy
creation:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Consequences Table</i>
<p>Data from the Consequences Table can help you identify the
consequences that are perceived as undesirable for important players.
Winning the support of opposing players may require negotiating these
consequences, providing some compensation, or making compromises in the
policy's <i>Goals</i> or <i>Mechanisms</i>. Which aspects of the policy
might be modified in order to improve the likelihood of success for the
entire proposal? Will strengthening important elements of the policy
increase support significantly among those who are already its
proponents? </p>
</li>
<li><i>Interests Table</i>
<p>Data from the Interests Table can help explain why players have taken
their positions. Can you design strategies that satisfy the interests of
opponents without undermining the effectiveness of the policy and without
reducing the level of support from proponents? </p>
</li>
<li><i>Opportunities and Obstacles for Players</i>
<p>Review each opportunity and each action you identified to take
advantage of transitions underway. Consider various sources of
opportunity, at the levels of individual, organization, and political
environment. Often, a new leader or a new political regime offers a
window of opportunity for change; if you miss that chance, the window may
shut quickly and tightly. Review each obstacle and each action you
identified to overcome the obstacle. Consider how you might be able to
overcome each obstacle, or if that is not possible, lessen its impact on
the feasibility of your policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p></p>


<h2><a id="polh4yk3"></a>Opportunities and Obstacles (Step 3A)</h2>

<p>The Opportunities and Obstacles step asks you to identify and assess
transitions that may present opportunities to enhance the political
feasibility of the policy or those that may create significant obstacles to
your policy goals. Decisions about public policy rarely occur in static
environments. This phase of the analysis helps you identify opportunities for
influence that may arise because of changes in individuals (who hold
leadership or implementation roles), in the implementing organization, in
other organizations, and in the social and political environments. It may
also help you identify obstacles that can interfere with achieving your
goals.</p>

<p>For each player in your analysis, PolicyMaker provides a text box to enter
a summary of any opportunities, and one to describe any possible
obstacles.</p>

<p>This analysis of opportunities and obstacles asks for the following
information:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Opportunity </i>
<p>Provide a brief description of the opportunity. For example, the
opportunity may involve a change in leadership, or a new source of
financial support, or a loss of high-level political support. Also, in
this box, briefly describe an action that could take advantage of the
opportunity, to influence the policymaking process and create support for
your policy. This statement can be used in PolicyMaker's next step to
help you <a href="#polh51pt">design effective strategies</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Obstacle</em>
<p>Provide a brief description of the obstacle. Also, in the box, briefly
describe an action that could overcome this obstacle, to influence the
policymaking process and enhance the feasibility of your policy. This
statement can be used in PolicyMaker's next step to help you <a
href="#polh51pt">design effective strategies</a>. </p>
</li>
</ul>


<p></p>
<h2><a id="polh51pt"></a>Suggested Strategies (Step 3B)</h2>

<p>This step in the PolicyMaker method helps you design and assess strategies
for change in the policymaking process. The strategies are intended to shape
the power, positions, and numbers of players, and thereby determine your
policy's political feasibility. The design of effective strategies is one of
PolicyMaker's most important products. PolicyMaker provides an expert system
to improve this critical step of political analysis. </p>

<p>PolicyMaker provides two methods for strategy design: First, the program
provides a generic set of suggested political strategies, which you can apply
or adapt to your policy problem. Second, the program allows you to review
information you have already entered in your analysis of players and asks you
to use this information to construct appropriate strategies.</p>

<p>The Suggested Strategies window displays possible strategies divided into
three groups: </p>
<ul>
<li>Strategies to strengthen support.</li>
<li>Strategies to mobilize the non-mobilized.</li>
<li>Strategies to minimize opposition.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also skip this step of computer-assisted strategy design, and go
directly to the <a href="#polh51pv">Strategy Table</a> to create your own
strategies.</p>

<p>When you click on one of the suggested strategies, the <em>Add New 
Strategy Based on Suggested Strategy</em> window appears. </p>

<p>In a drop-down box at the top is a list of players divided in groups based on their
estimated current position. Click on one or more of the players who might be
best affected by the selected strategy. </p>

<p>You can customize the strategy to meet the circumstances of your policy by
providing information in the <i>Action, Challenges</i> or <em>Timeline</em>
box. Clicking on <i>OK</i> will return you to the Strategy Table or Suggested
Strategies window.  Clicking on <i>Add Another</i> will display an empty box to
enter another strategy.</p>

<p>Aside from <em>Players</em>, the Add a Strategy window has the following
fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Strategy Name</i>
<p>Give each strategy a brief name that refers, for example, to the type
of action proposed or the target of the action. You will see this name
when you open the Strategy Impacts table. When you create a strategy
using the Suggested Strategies feature, the Strategy Name will be
provided for you; you can edit this later by accessing the strategy from
the Strategy Table.</p>
</li>
<li><i>Action</i>
<p>Describe the action that the strategy entails. Be specific about who
should do what and when. For example, a strategy to enhance the power of
supporters might have the name, "Strengthen Supporting Groups," and the
action of "Provide organizational resources to supporting group x, by
assigning John Clark to work with the group for six months." </p>
</li>
<li><em>Challenges</em>
<p>Analyze human, financial and other challenges of implementing the
action you have defined.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Timeline</em>
<p>Provide an outline of the timeline to implement your strategy.
Consider milestones or steps necessary to implement the strategy. </p>
</li>
<li><em>Probability of Success</em>
<p>Set a value from 0% (no chance) to 100% (certainty) for the
probability that your strategy will have the expected impacts on the
positions or power of the players you selected. You can enter an exact
value in the box , or click on a radio button to select a quintile
choice. When you enter an exact value, the nearest quintile choice is
selected for you. The default probability is an optimistic 100%. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Through this process, PolicyMaker helps you design effective strategies
for change. But you still need to ask and seek answers to a number of tough
questions of political analysis. Some of those questions include the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Which player should you start with in seeking to change the balance
of power on the Position Map?</i><br>
<br>
</li>
<li><i>What kinds of resources (incentives or pressures) are likely to be
most effective in changing the position of a particular player?</i><br>
<br>
</li>
<li><i>How many players need to be shifted, in order to make a policy
sufficiently feasible?</i><br>
<br>
</li>
<li><i>Can you redesign some of the policy goals or policy measures in
order to improve the policy's overall likelihood of success?</i><br>
<br>
</li>
<li><i>How can you best take advantage of political transitions and the
opportunities associated with those transitions?</i></li>
</ul>

<p>The construction of strategies represents one of PolicyMaker's most
important steps. But strategies alone do not yield feasibility. You still
need to envision likely impacts. Carrying out these steps can help you seek
answers to the tough questions of politics, and can improve your skills in
the art of policymaking.</p>

<p>When you have finished creating the strategy, click on <i>OK</i></p>

<h2><a id="polh51pv"></a>Strategy Table (Step 3C)</h2>

<p>The Strategy Table displays all of your strategies, with basic information
for each strategy.</p>

<p>The Strategy Table presents data on all strategies entered either via the
Add button on the Strategy Table screen, or via the <a
href="#polh51pt">Suggested Strategies</a> feature, including the strategy
name and action, impacted players, and the likely challenges and timeline. In
some cases, you may work with an advisor to the policymaker in preparing or
reviewing these strategies and in assessing the expected challenges and
timeline. The final choice of strategies, however, is usually up to the
policymaker, who must decide whether the desired policy is worth the
political risks of the proposed actions.</p>

<p>To add strategies from this window, click on <i>Add</i> on the toolbar,
which displays the Add a Strategy window. (See the <a
href="#polh51pt">Suggested Strategies</a> topic for information about the
fields in the Add/Edit Strategy window.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="polh54vk"></a>Strategy Impacts (Step 4)</h2>

<p>In the fifth and final step, you assess each strategy's likely impacts on
the power and position of major players. PolicyMaker uses this
information to calculate the aggregate impacts of a strategy package, and to
display a comparison of current and future feasibility. This feature allows
you to visualize alternative future scenarios. Once a strategy package is
selected, the program can be used to monitor the implementation of strategies
and compare observed and expected impacts.</p>

<p>Substeps:</p>
<div class="indentsect">
<p><a href="#polh54vl"><b>Strategy Impacts (Step 4A)</b></a></p>

<p><a href="#polh54vm"><b>Position Map - Future (Step 4B)</b></a></p>

</div>
<p><a href="#polh58tu"><b>Calculating the Feasibility Indices</b></a></p>
<p></p>

<h2><a id="polh54vl"></a>Strategy Impacts (Step 4A)</h2>

<p>This step in the PolicyMaker method helps you assess each strategy's
likely impacts on the power and position of major players.
PolicyMaker<i></i>uses this information to calculate the aggregate impacts of
a strategy package, and then allows you to compare the current and future
feasibility of your policy. These features allow you to visualize alternative
future scenarios. Finally, once you select a strategy, you can use the
program to monitor the implementation of strategies and compare the observed
and expected impacts.<br>
</p>

<p>When you click on the Strategy Impacts button, or select Step 4A on the
Impacts panel, PolicyMaker will ask you to select a strategy. Each display of
the Strategy Impacts window is based on the expected impacts of a
<i>particular</i> strategy on the position and power of players. If you
have not entered any strategies, the Strategy Impacts Table will be blank.</p>

<p>The top of the Strategy Impacts window displays a summary of the strategy:
its name, action, and timeline. </p>

<p>In the table below, you can identify players whose position or power
might be impacted by this strategy. You should only list those players whose
position or power is expected to change. </p>

<p>To add a player to the list, return to the <a href="#polh51pv">Strategy
Table</a> and edit the strategy. </p>

<p>The Strategy Impacts window will automatically provide the player's
<i>Current Position </i>as recorded in the Player Table. You should estimate
how the strategy will affect the player's position and then select the
player's probable <i>Future Position</i>. The window also gives the player's
<i>Current Power</i> and allows you to set the player's likely <i>Future
Power</i>. </p>

<p>To enter a <i>Future Position</i> or<i>Future Power</i>, right click the player and select 
<i>Edit</i>.  Scroll the Future Position and Power to set values.  Click on <i>OK</i> to save.</p>

<p>The <i>Future Position</i> and <i>Future Power</i> information allows
PolicyMaker to create the Future Position Map, which shows how a strategy (or
a combination of strategies) would change the Position Map. The information
is also used to create the Future Feasibility Graph.</p>

<h2><a id="polh54vm"></a>Position Map - Future (Step 4B)</h2>

<p>The Future Position Map shows how the player positions and power will
change, based on the predicted impacts of a selection of strategies. In
short, this window allows you to envision a future political scenario for
your policy.</p>

<p>When you click on the <i>Position Map - Future</i> button (or tab) you
will be asked to select a set of strategies, through the Select Strategies to
Map window. You can select (or unselect) individual strategies in the
<i>Strategy</i> list. Alternatively, click on the <em>Check All</em> button
to select all strategies. To clear the selection, click on <em>Uncheck all
All.</em> If no strategies are selected, the Position Map - Future will
display the same data as Position Map - Current.</p>

<p>If more than one strategy affects a player, the system calculates a best
guess of the combined impacts of the strategies by averaging their values.</p>

<p>To alter your list of strategies displayed in the Position Map - Future,
click on the <i>Strategies</i> button for the Select Strategies to Map
window, and then select or unselect strategies. When the current positions
are shown, click on the <i>Future</i> button (in the lower left corner) to
display the expected future positions.</p>

<h2><a id="polh54vn"></a>Feasibility Graph - Future (Step 4C)</h2>

<p>The Feasibility Graph - Future shows a quantitative assessment of the
feasibility of your policy as a result of the selected strategies. </p>

<p>When you click on the <i>Feasibility Graph - Future </i>button you will be
asked to select a set of strategies, through the Select Strategies to Graph
window. You can select (or unselect) individual strategies in the
<i>Strategy</i> list. Alternatively, click on the <em>Check All</em> button
to select all strategies. To clear the selection, click on <em>Uncheck
All.</em> To calculate the Feasibility Graph - Future however, you must first
enter at least one strategy (Step 3B or 3C) and assess the likely impacts of
that strategy (Step 4A).</p>


<p>To alter your list of strategies to display, click on the
<i>Strategies</i> button for the Select Strategies to Map window, and then
select or de-select strategies. </p>

<p>See also, the <a href="#polh4veb">Feasibility Graph - Current</a> and
the topic on <a href="#polh58tu">Calculating the Feasibility
Indices</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="polh58tu"></a>Calculating the Feasibility Indices</h2>

<p>The Feasibility Algorithm is used to calculate the indices of support and
opposition shown in the <a href="#polh4veb">Feasibility Graph</a>. </p>

<p>The Feasibility Algorithm is a mathematical formula involving players'
positions and power. The algorithm is applied to each player included in
the analysis, producing a value that is added to the appropriate index
(support, non-mobilized, or opposition), to create the <em>Feasibility Graph
- Current</em>.</p>

<p>In the Current context, for each supporting and opposing player, the
power value (always a positive value) is multiplied by the position's
intensity to arrive at a score for the player. For supporters, position
intensity is the Position value. For opponents, the position intensity is 
the absolute value of the Position value.</p>

<p>Therefore, if Player A (a supporter) has a position value (intensity) of
5.5, and a power value of 4.2, the player's score will be 23.1. This
score will be added to the index for Supporters.</p>

<p>Since Non-mobilized players have no "intensity", a special constant value
is used for intensity - the <em>Position Intensity for Non-Mobilized</em>
setting. This value is set to 5.</p>

<p>When the <em>Feasibility Graph - Future</em> is generated, the program
averages the strategy impacts for each player and determines the combined
impact. The Feasibility Algorithm is then applied to that impact, resulting
in a feasibility value for each player. This value is then added to the
appropriate index (for support, non-mobilized, or opposition). The three
indices are then shown on the Future Feasibility Graph.</p>

<p>The model embodied in the feasibility algorithm inevitably simplifies
reality. We have sought to make the model's assumptions reasonable,
transparent, and modifiable. If used with some caution, the feasibility
algorithm can help you graphically estimate both current and future levels of
support and opposition for a policy. But the multiple uncertainties and
informed guesses involved in calculating the Feasibility Graph should not be
forgotten. See the topic on the <a href="#polh4veb">Feasibility Graph</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="polh54vo"></a>Strategy Implementation (Step 4D)</h2>

<p>This final step in the PolicyMaker method helps you plan and track the
implementation of your strategies. This table shows each expected impact of
your strategies, listed according to the strategy name and player impacts.
You can also use this table to assign an individual the responsibility for
managing the implementation of each strategy.</p>

<p>When you access the Strategy Implementation screen, the Strategy Implementation: Select
Strategies window will be presented. Select one, more, or all strategies. </p>

<p>Fields on the Strategy Implementation Table are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Strategy (name)</i>
<p>This column provides the name of the strategy. A strategy may appear
more than once, because each player impact of a strategy appears on a
separate row. In other words, there is a row in this table for every
strategy-to-player combination.</p>
</li>
<li><i>Expected Impact</i>
<p>This column provides the player name and the expected changes in
position and/or power that you have entered. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Success (%) (Period)</i>
<p>This field records the strategy's level of success that you observe at
different time periods, compared to your expected impact. The field will
accept percent values between 0% and 100%, and automatically shades the
display with a color codes based on your input. There is one column for
each of three time periods. To set the time periods, see the <a
href="#polh9qwg">Project Settings</a>.
Values are color coded based on quintile.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>The Implementation Table allows you to sort all rows by strategy name, by
level of success for the three periods, or by whether an assignment has been
made.</p>

<p>Right-click on a row to make changes to the values and select Edit - the <em>Edit
Strategy Implementation</em> box will be displayed.</p>

<h2><a id="polh9nqr"></a>Summary</h2>

<p>PolicyMaker has the ability to generate an HTML report of the entire
project.  Click on the Summary option under Summary and Settings.  
A single-page report of the project will be displayed.</p>

<h2><a id="polh9qwg"></a>Project Settings</h2>

<p>The Project Settings window is accessible from the Summary and Settings Menu.</p>

<p>All data on the Project Settings window applies to the current project only. </p>

<p>The top panel on the Project Settings window 
allows you to view and edit basic data concerning your project. The following fields are editable:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Full Project Name</i>
<p>You can use the <i>Full Project Name</i> field to define the full name for
your project. This is the name (key) of the project in Local Storage.
Only the first 45 characters of the <i>Project Name</i>
will appear in the Projects window. You may want to phrase your project
name so that the most important information appears in the first 25
characters which always show on screen. In some cases, you may want to start the project name with your name.</p>
</li>
<li><i>Analyst Name</i>
<p>The <i>Analyst</i> field can be used to record who prepared the
analysis. </p>
</li>
<li><i>Client Name</i>
<p>The <i>Client Name</i> field can be used to record who commissioned or
requested the analysis. 
</p>
</li>
<li><i>Policy Date</i>
<p>The <i>Policy Date</i> identifies the time period of the project. 
</p>
</li>
<li><i>Analysis Date</i>
<p>The <i>Analysis Date</i> identifies when the analysis was done.
</p>
</li>
<li><i>Implementation Periods</i>
<p>The <a href="#polh54vo">Strategy Implementation Table</a> allows
you to enter information concerning the observed level of success for
each strategy. Use these three fields to set the time periods you will
use to track implementation. These values will appear as the column headings for
the three probability columns on the table.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Click on <em>Save</em> to save your values to your project.</p>

<h2>Customizing Lists and 
Levels</h2>

<p>Following the main fields are five boxes that allow you to modify the
contents of five drop-down list boxes associated with Players and Policy
Content entries in PolicyMaker. When you create a project, each list is
filled with a standard set of entries. You can then use the <i>Lists</i>
feature to customize each list for a specific project. </p>

<p>Changing the contents of the lists will not change any of the data already
entered. For example, if you delete "Commercial" from the Player Sector list,
any players set as commercial will remain so. All four drop-down list boxes
allow you to enter values that do not appear in the list, giving you wide
flexibility when using the list-boxes in the program.</p>

<p>To change an entry in a list (such as to correct the spelling of an
entry), delete the entry and then add the corrected entry. Deleting or adding an item saves the values.</p>
